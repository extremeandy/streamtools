#![cfg_attr(all(doc, CHANNEL_NIGHTLY), feature(doc_auto_cfg))]

//! Additional stream combinators.
//!
//! ## Feature flags
//!
//! - `tokio-time`: Enables combinators which depend on the tokio crate and its time feature, in particular:
//!   - [`sample_by_duration`](crate::StreamTools::sample_by_duration)
//!   - [`sample_by_interval`](crate::StreamTools::sample_by_interval)
//! - `test-util`: Exposes utilities for testing streams, in particular:
//!   - [`delay_items`](crate::test_util::delay_items)
//!   - [`record_delay`](crate::StreamTools::record_delay)
